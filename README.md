# PROJECT DESCRIPTION :

Anomaly detection has been an important topic in data mining and machine
learning. Many real-world applications such as intrusion detection require an effective
and efficient technique to identify deviated data instances. Most of the anomaly detection
methods are typically implemented in batch mode, and thus cannot be easily extended to
large-scale problems without sacrificing computation and memory requirements.
The Oversampling Principal Component Analysis (osPCA) algorithm is
used to address this problem, and aims at detecting the presence of outliers from a large
amount of data via an online updating technique. Unlike prior PCA based approaches, it
does not store the entire data matrix or covariance matrix, and thus this approach is
especially of interest in online or large-scale problems. By over-sampling the target
instance and extracting the principal direction of the data, the proposed osPCA determine
the anomaly of the target instance according to the variation of the resulting dominant
eigenvector.
The project involves an online anomaly detection method based on over-sample
Principal Component Analysis. It shows that the osPCA with Least One Out (LOO)
strategy will amplify the effect of outliers. When oversampling a data instance, the online
updating technique permits the osPCA to efficiently replace the traditional route without
solving Eigen stuff and decomposition problems. Furthermore, the approach does not
need to preserve the whole covariance or facts matrices during the online detection
method. Therefore, compared with other anomaly detection techniques, this method is
able to achieve nice effects even as substantially lowering computational expenses and
minimum requirements.
